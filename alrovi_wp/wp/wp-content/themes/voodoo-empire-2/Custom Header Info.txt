If you wish to add text over the main banner image, follow these instructions:

Open header.php and near the bottom find the following code:

<div id="banner">
		<div id="banner_title">				
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
  </div>
			<div id="banner_text">
				
			</div>
          </div>


You can simply type in some changes as shown below:


<div id="banner">
		<div id="banner_title">				
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A SECONDARY BLOG TITLE CAN GO HERE</p>
  </div>
			<div id="banner_text">
				AND A SMALL DESCRIPTION OF YOUR SITE CAN GO HERE
			</div>
          </div>

These options were left open for you to type whatever you want, and don't automatically add in your
blogs name or tagline, since those are already included in the theme at the very top.
