This Theme is preconfigured to allow you to include banner ads if you so desire, using the Ad-Minister plugin.

The plugin is located at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ad-minister/

The theme is set-up ONLY for standard size banner ads (468x60)

In ad-minister you MUST set up a position called 'banner'(no quotes), and ensure that all 
images you want displayed are set in that position.

If all steps above are followed the banner will be positioned above the header image in 
the top bar toward the right side.  (can be seen at http://www.rvoodoo.com)
