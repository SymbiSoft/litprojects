This theme is preconfigured to support the dtabs plugin located at
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/dtabs/

configure the plugin according to their instructions.  The tabs will be located
directly under the header image.  (you will have to tweak the css a little if
you want colours to match.)

This can be seen at my site (http://www.rvoodoo.com)

If you choose not to use this plugin it will not affect the theme at all
